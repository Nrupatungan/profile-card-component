## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to insert multiple background images and position them on the screen. It was all about trial and error, but I got my desired result at the end, that's all that matters.

```css
body{
    background-image: url(./images/bg-pattern-top.svg), url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
    background-position: left -200vw bottom 45vh, right -200vw top 45vh;
    background-color: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I'd love to learn all the in's and out's of CSS Grid and use it in my future projects. I'm also looking towards learning Advanced HTML & CSS like embedding videos, tables, forms etc.
